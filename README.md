### Updates to templates for the 010 editor

The Official Template Repository (https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/repository/templates/)
has released versions of these templates into the public domain.

### Purpose
This is simply to track the changes I make to these templates.
It may also provide an easier review method if I push these to Sweetscape.
